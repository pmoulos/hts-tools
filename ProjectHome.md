# Summary #
This is my personal collection of small (and some larger) tools for the analysis of Next Generation Sequencing data, useful for ChIP-Seq, RNA-Seq and methylation analysis as well as motif scanning. They are written mostly in Perl and R and most of them are extensively documented. For the Perl scripts, just type perl scriptname.pl --help to get usage help. For the R and Shell scripts, just see the code which is usually documented at the beginning.
